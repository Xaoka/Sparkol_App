# Sparkol_App

## Sparkol Unattended Programming Test

We are creating a static web application that will eventually be user-facing and in a production environment. This is a greenfield project, no code currently exists so feel free to make an educated decision on which language/framework/libraries to use.
A user authentication service has recently been developed (<https://github.com/dantame/interview-authentication-service>) and this project will be the first to integrate with it.

## The user stories

1. As a user, I would like to be able to log in to the web application
2. As a user, I would like to view a personalised greeting when I log in so that I know Iâ€™m logged in
3. As a user, I would like to be able to log out of the application

## Rules

There are no rules to how you write your code and no trick questions! Treat this like you
would treat building any production-ready application from scratch. You may use any
programming language, libraries or framework you wish.
Please submit your project (either as a public repository or zip file) including instructions on
how to run it. If submitting as a zip, please include your .git directory (or equivalent) so that we
can see the commit history.
